Morricone was initially hesitant to work with Tarantino due to his previous comments on the director's use of music in his films, but was convinced by the dense script and Tarantino's personal visit to his home. The score features a seven-minute suite called L'Ultima Diligenza per Red Rock, which Morricone is particularly proud of and finds expresses the drama, rage, despair, and irony of the film's story through the use of bassoon, contra-bassoon, and tuba. Despite his age and back injury, Morricone is looking forward to his upcoming concerts and finds playing themes from his films an ""incredibly gratifying experience."""
