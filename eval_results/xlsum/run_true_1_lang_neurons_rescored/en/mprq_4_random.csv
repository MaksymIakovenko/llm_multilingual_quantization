A British man linked to 11 cases of coronavirus has now left hospital, and a total of 1,750 people have tested negative for the virus in the UK, with eight testing positive. The main aim is to identify people quickly, trace close contacts at risk of infection, and keep them in isolation. Children do not need to be taken out of school and isolated unless necessary. The virus has spread to over 20 countries, and the World Health Organization has named the disease caused by the coronavirus as Covid-19. Infectious disease expert Prof Neil Ferguson believes new cases of the virus could still rise, and virologist Prof John Oxford thinks people's actions can help slow transmission. The main symptoms of coronavirus are fever and cough, and frequent hand washing and avoiding close contact with people who are ill can help stop its spread."
