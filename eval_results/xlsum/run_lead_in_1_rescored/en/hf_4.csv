His speech was seen as unusually bleak and angry, with some comparing it to a villainous speech from the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises. While some praised the authenticity and determination of the speech, others were skeptical of the breadth of his plans to take power away from Washington DC and create jobs. The speech was seen as a pivot away from the populist message of his campaign, with some arguing that he is now focusing on finding solutions to the country's problems."
