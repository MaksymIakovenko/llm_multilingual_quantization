To summarize, you are arguing that the concept of ""tự do"" in the Vietnamese revolution is not as simple as just being about individual freedom, but rather it is about the collective struggle for independence and self-determination. You are suggesting that the Vietnamese people have the right to determine their own future and that their struggle for independence is a natural extension of their desire for self-determination.  While I understand your point, I must respectfully disagree with your characterization of the Vietnamese revolution. The Vietnamese revolution was a complex and multifaceted event that involved many different actors and factors, including political, social, and economic considerations.

This approach involves gathering information from various sources and using it to determine the enterprise's value, rather than relying solely on the government's assessment.  Regarding the slow pace of privatization, Director Tien noted that the process can be complex and time-consuming, as it involves evaluating the value of large state-owned enterprises and determining the appropriate price for their sale."

However, it failed to attract users and was eventually shut down in 2019 due to several reasons.  One of the main reasons for Google+'s failure was its poor user interface and lack of features compared to its competitors. The platform also faced criticism for its ""Plus One"" button, which was seen as confusing and difficult to use.  Another factor that contributed to Google+'s demise was its forced integration with other Google services, such as Gmail and YouTube. This made it difficult for users to keep their personal information separate from their Google accounts.  In addition, Google+ faced criticism for its data handling practices, including the collection and storage of personal data without proper consent. This led to several privacy violations and data breaches, which further eroded user trust in the platform.  Despite its failure, Google+ still holds a special place in the history of social media.

The education system in Vietnam has been criticized for being outdated and not meeting the needs of students.

I completely agree with the author that the current education system in Vietnam is too focused on passing exams and memorizing information, rather than developing practical skills and creativity. This has led to a lack of innovation and critical thinking among students, as they are not encouraged to think independently or come up with new ideas.  Moreover, the author raises an important point about the importance of developing a sense of national identity and pride among students. This can be achieved by incorporating more Vietnamese literature and culture into the curriculum, as well as by encouraging students to engage with their community and participate in social activities.

The article highlights several examples of Vietnam's cooperation with Russia and Belarus, including the purchase of military equipment and the training of Vietnamese police officers. The author suggests that Vietnam's close relationship with these countries is due to their shared communist ideology and their desire to counter US influence in the region.
