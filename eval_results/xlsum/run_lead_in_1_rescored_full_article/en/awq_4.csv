He vowed to end ""American carnage"" and promised to give power back to the people, but his plans and policies remain unclear. The speech was met with mixed reactions, with some seeing it as authentic and determined, while others were skeptical of his ability to follow through on his promises."

The study, which analyzed data from across England, showed that poorer students are on average three A-level grades behind their more affluent peers. The gap is larger in A-levels than vocational qualifications, and there are variations across different areas, with poorer students falling further behind in some areas.
